I grew up in Pomona California. A child of immigrants from Mexico, my parents worked hard to provide for me and push me foward to become the first in my family to attend college, and the first to earn a gradute degree. 
My academic journey began at East Los Angeles College. I commuted to and from school and worked night shifts at a UPS Warehouse.
